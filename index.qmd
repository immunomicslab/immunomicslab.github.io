_The Computational Autoimmunity Group, led by Associate Professor Leon Eyrich Jessen, is based at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), just north of Copenhagen._

We are a bioinformatics research group working at the intersection of computational immunology and autoimmune disease research. Our focus lies in developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning and AI methodologies to understand how immune cell populations and their molecular signatures relate to disease phenotypes.

Our research is anchored in three core themes:

1. **Immunocellular Profiling in Autoimmune Disease:**
We investigate the diversity and specificity of the immune repertoire, particularly T-cell receptors (TCRs), in the context of autoimmune disorders, aiming to understand how immune recognition contributes to the breakdown of central tolerance.

2. **Single-Cell Analysis in Immunology:**
We leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and related technologies to characterize immune cell states at high resolution, providing detailed insights into disease-associated immune cell composition and dynamics.

3. **Machine Learning, AI and Integrative Modeling:**
To analyze complex, high-dimensional data, we develop and apply a range of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, generative models, and probabilistic frameworks, to derive interpretable, data-driven insights.

_Our work is highly collaborative, with close ties to clinical partners, and is driven by a shared goal: to advance precision immunology and improve understanding of immune-mediated disease._
