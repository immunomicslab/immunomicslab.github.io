_The Computational Autoimmunity Group headed by Associate Professor Leon Eyrich Jessen is located at the Technical University of Denmark, just north of Copenhagen, Denmark_

The work we do is centered around computational immunology, with a specific focus on autoimmune disease. We develop and apply bioinformatics and machine learning methods to investigate the interplay between immuno-cellular composition and autoimmune disease phenotypes primarily using single-cell immune profiling approaches. Our research ranges from developing precision immunoprofiles to integrating multi-modal data for applications in disease stratification, diagnostics, and mechanistic insights into T-cell repertoire diversity and composition.

Our research is driven by three core themes:

1. **Immunocellular profiling in Autoimmune Disease:** We are particularly interested in understanding how T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity and repertoires interact with autoimmune disease phenotypes aiming to address fundamental questions of immune recognition and activation in breaking central tolerance.

2. **Single-Cell Analysis in Immunology:** To investigate 1., a significant portion of our work leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to conduct in-depth characterization of immune cell types and composition profiling at the single-cell level.

3. **Machine Learning and Integrative Modeling:** To extract insights from 1. using 2., we are developing and applying advanced machine learning methodology, including deep learning, generative neural networks, and probabilistic modeling. 

These focal themes underscore our commitment to advancing computational immunology by employing data-driven, machine-learning approaches to decipher immune function and disease-specific immune responses. Our collaborations with other institutions reflect a clear orientation toward translational applications in autoimmune disease.
