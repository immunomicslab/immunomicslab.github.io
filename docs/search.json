    "text": "In the Computational Autoimmunity group, we work on increasing our understanding of what happens when central tolerance is broken, how the specificity of our immune system defines self and non-self, aiming at elucidating the immuno-cellular mechanisms influencing autoimmune disease. Furthermore, a key element of the group activities is the development and application of computational technology aiming at solving bioinformatics challenges, where we have a strong emphasis on machine learning based tools. Our primary goal for research-to-application is to apply said tools and to make them available to the community.\nA key approach to interrogating the immuno-cellular mechanisms influencing autoimmune disease is single-cell analysis. Single-cell analysis has transformed the resolution level for understanding complex cellular interactions. The field is rapidly evolving and in the Computational Autoimmunity group, we actively work to engage the national and international community through outreach and interaction.\nWe are always open for collaborations, so do not hesitate to contact us for more information."
